I'm using this site as a temporary blog since I was encouraged to start a writing blog (and it's free).

I'm a linguistics student studying in Canada. I've recently been researching Internet memes, so I might use this site to jumpstart my creative processes for that.

Feel free to send me a message or contact me if you want. I'm not incredibly responsive, but I like talking about interesting things.
