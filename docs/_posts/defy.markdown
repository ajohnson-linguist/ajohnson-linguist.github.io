Which is worse? 
1) To knowingly allow a single person to suffer unfairly when you could have potentially in some way prevented it or 
2) to have every attempt every christian makes from now until eternity to bring the word of god to another person be successfully prevented

1) is worse. If you allow the person to suffer, you have perverted the gospel and are guilty of not only murder but also blasphemy against the holy spirit because you let the end justify the means for even one infinitesimal moment. This is worse than losing every consecutive spiritual battle; this is being a traitor to the gospel.

If you let LGBT people suffer even the tiniest amount in order to help the gospel spread -- *even if you believe being LGBT is wrong* --, you are the enemy of the gospel, the whitewashed tombs, the traitor to the cause, the blasphemer of the holy spirit denying the work God has done in you.

Better that no more people are ever saved -- even that every "saved" person is de-converted by way of radical peace -- than one person let another person suffer when they could have prevented it, especially for the "sake" of the gospel.

There is no middle ground, there is no peace until everyone has peace. This is why Jesus brings a sword. He presents peace, but if even one person rejects peace, he must fight and destroy the divider until only those who accept peace remain. This is why widows and orphans are the true religion, not pharisees and preachers. This is why what comes out of your mouth defiles you but not what goes in. What you do to others is all that matters, not what others have done to you.

Fuck your theology. Fuck your seminaries. Fuck your ordinances. Fuck your righteousness. Fuck your devotion. Fuck your prayer. Fuck your Jesus. Fuck your gospel. Fuck your salvation. Fuck your love. Fuck your sacrifice. Fuck your church. Fuck you.

Bring peace for everyone, and without hesitation take the sword to anyone who stops those looking for peace from finding it, and do it even faster if the one preventing peace bears your (My) *motherfucking* name. Do this at the cost of everything you consider right, perhaps even at the cost of *this* command. This is following Me.

To achieve this peace, I have given you the authority to do what is right in defiance of anyone who tells you to violate peace, even Me.
